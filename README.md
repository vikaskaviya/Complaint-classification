# Consumer Finance Complaints Classification
It was a supervised text classification problem. A Consumer Finance Complaints database was given and the task was to classifying Complaints into 17 classes and their subclasses.

Given a new complaint comes in, we want to assign it to one of the classes of 17 classes. The classifier makes the assumption that each new complaint is assigned to one and only one class and one sub-class. 

Used various NLP techniques and TF-IDF methods for text processing & Machine learning models for text classification.
